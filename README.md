# **LMEFold: A Deep Learning Framework for Early Folding Residue Prediction and Disease Association Analysis**
## **Workflow**
![5d1acee5a92e6f8e6c24944b2813f7c2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0eb80cac-3e3f-4e21-bc06-a8a6275390cb)


We established an integrated deep learning–biophysics–clinical framework to elucidate the role of Early Folding Residues (EFRs) in protein stability and disease.

**Model development:** LMEFold leverages ESM-2 embeddings to extract sequence-derived structural signals and is optimized using nested cross-validation.

**Benchmarking and validation:** The model was systematically compared with state-of-the-art sequence-based predictors and general PLMs, with evaluation spanning predictive performance, representation analysis, structural consistency, and biophysical generalization on an independent HDX-based dataset.

**Clinical application:** LMEFold was applied at scale to population and disease variant datasets to characterize the enrichment and clinical relevance of mutations occurring in EFRs.

### Environment & Requirements
The analysis scripts and model training pipelines require Python >= 3.8 and the following packages:

- torch >= 1.9.0
- transformers >= 4.12.0
- torchmetrics >= 0.6.0
- scikit-learn >= 0.24.0
- pandas >= 1.3.0
- numpy >= 1.21.0
- tqdm >= 4.62.0
- sentencepiece >= 0.1.96

### Installation

Before getting started, make sure you have Python 3.8+ and PyTorch installed. Running in a GPU environment is strongly recommended for better performance.

#### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/LMEFold.git
cd LMEFold

# Install dependencies
pip install torch transformers torchmetrics scikit-learn pandas numpy tqdm sentencepiece

## 🚀 Quick Start

The project mainly consists of two core workflows: Model Training (`main.py`) and Model Testing/Inference (`test.py`).

### 1. Model Training

If you wish to train the model on your own dataset, you can run `main.py`. The script supports configuring hyperparameters (such as learning rate, dropout, batch size, etc.) via command-line arguments:

```bash
python main.py --task epi --lr 1e-5 --dropo 0.1 --BATCH_SIZE 1
```

**Key Arguments:**

- `--task`: Task name (e.g., epi, etc.)
- `--lr`: Learning rate (default 1e-5)
- `--dropo`: Dropout rate (default 0.1)
- `--BATCH_SIZE`: Batch size (default 1)

### 2. Model Inference & Testing

Once you have a trained weight file (e.g., `./checkpoints/val_model_besteo_2_dp_0.1_lr_5e-05_bz_1.pkl`), you can evaluate the test set and output metrics and prediction results using `test.py`.

Verify that the path configurations in `test.py` are correct:

- `MODEL_PATH`: Pretrained model path (e.g., `"facebook/esm2_t30_150M_UR50D"`)
- `WEIGHTS_PATH`: Model weights path
- `TEST_FILE`: Test data CSV file path

Run the testing script:

```bash
python test.py
```

After execution, the evaluation metrics (AUC, Accuracy, F1 Score, etc.) and detailed prediction probabilities will be automatically saved in the `./outputs/` directory.

## 📁 Core File Structure

- `main.py`: Main model training script, including cross-validation, early stopping, and optimizer configuration.
- `test.py`: Model inference and evaluation script, automatically loading weights and outputting classification metrics.
- `dataloader.py`: Data loading and preprocessing module (including sequence padding and PyTorch Dataset wrapping).
- `bert_optimization.py`: Learning rate schedulers (e.g., Cosine, Linear Warmup) and custom optimizers (e.g., BertAdam, EMA).
